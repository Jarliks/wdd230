          <p class="content">
            Our primary audience will be local business owners who seek to work
            together to improve the business climate of the area, but other
            visitors may include those who are looking into the area as a
            possible place to start a business, move, or even just visit. The
            age range will include those still running businesses, either early
            in life or right before retirement, so we can expect anyone from
            20-65.
