            Regardless of what you think about the content of their news
            stories, CNN's mobile site does a great job at managing visual
            hierarchy to deliver the information they want to. The use of fonts,
            colors, and images lead the eyes to the headline first, followed by
            the banner above, then down to the image, followed by the caption
            and then other possible news stories you may be interested in.

            Apple as a company has built their modern image on sleek design and
            a clean look. Its no surprise their company site does a great job at
            displaying this principle. There is no clutter, nothing getting in
            the way, and everything feels well-spaced, you don't have to look
            through anything that you aren't there to find.

          <p class="block-content">
            While it could also be used as a good example for some other
            principles, Shopify is clever in how it uses contrast. Because their
            products are other web pages, which are often white or otherwise
            lightly colored, the Shopify site has a dark green background with
            white text on it in the places where it presents these images,
            allowing for both the images and the text to contrast well from the
            background.
